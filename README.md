Homework-4
==========

Problem 1:
After running the code in isInfinite, (which admittedly was a fairly small sample)
it appears that whenever a is odd and b is even, we get 0 or one primes (since the number will be even this makes sense.)
If a and b are both odd, it appears that the number of primes of the form x^2+ax+b will be infinite.
When a is even, I had more trouble figuring out which values of b will yield infinite primes.
Definitely need to run more tests here.

Problem 2:
